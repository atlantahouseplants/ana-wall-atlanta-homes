# Atlanta Houseplants Website - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: 404 NOT_FOUND on Vercel

### Possible Causes & Solutions

#### 1. **Missing Components**
Some components might not have been uploaded or have import errors.

**Solution**: Check that all these files exist in GitHub:
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- `src/components/CTAButton.tsx`
- All page files in `src/pages/`

#### 2. **Build Errors**
The build might be failing on Vercel due to TypeScript or import errors.

**Solution**: Check Vercel build logs:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check "Build Logs" for errors

#### 3. **Missing Dependencies**
Some npm packages might not be installing correctly.

**Solution**: Ensure `package.json` is uploaded and contains all dependencies.

#### 4. **Routing Issues**
Even with `vercel.json`, there might be routing problems.

**Solution**: Try accessing the direct Vercel URL first, then individual pages.

### Quick Fix: Simplified Version

If the current version isn't working, I can create a simplified version with:
- Basic HTML/CSS instead of complex components
- Inline styles instead of Tailwind classes
- Direct imports instead of path aliases

### Immediate Steps

1. **Check GitHub Repository**
   - Visit: https://github.com/atlantahouseplants/atlanta-houseplants
   - Verify ALL files are there (src folder, package.json, etc.)

2. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Note any missing files or import errors

3. **Try Alternative Deployment**
   - If Vercel continues to fail, we can try Netlify
   - Or create a static HTML version

### Contact Information
If you're still having issues, please share:
- Screenshot of GitHub repository file list
- Vercel build log errors (if any)
- Exact error message you're seeing

The website code is complete and should work - we just need to identify the specific deployment issue.
